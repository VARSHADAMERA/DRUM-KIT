# DRUM-KIT
 The drum kit project is a fun and interactive way to experience drumming on a static web page.
 The drum kit project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a interactive static web page that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on the image buttons. Each button on the drum kit corresponds to a specific drum sound, and when the user clicks on the button, the sound is played.
 
 The user interface of the drum kit is designed with HTML and CSS, which gives it a sleek and modern look.
 JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the drum kit. When a user clicks on a button, JavaScript detects the event and triggers the corresponding drum sound. Additionally, JavaScript is used to add animations to the buttons when they are clicked, which enhances the user experience and makes it more engaging.
 
 Overall,it showcases the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create static and engaging web experiences.
